# Monochrome_Metro
A game for the ATL Gamedevs Jam 2025

This is a first-person, point-and-click roguelite that transforms the mundane daily commute into a tense, high-stakes struggle for survival. Players must navigate a chaotic subway system under a strict time limit, constantly balancing their resources of Time, Money, and Stress while making critical risk/reward decisions during random events. The world is brought to life through a unique, hand-drawn monochrome art style, using layered silhouettes to create a powerful sense of atmospheric claustrophobia in the rush-hour crowd.
